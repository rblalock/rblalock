### 👨‍💻 1st Place - Palm Beach Hackathon

The goal for this entry is to creatively solve the River Center's and the Science Center's need to have interactive, interesting exhibits while getting feedback from visitors.

The entry walks visitors through a guided tour of exhibits, using artificial intelligence (IBM Watson), to best choose which exhibits match visitors' interests. Visitors are able to talk to a virtual guide and be directed to their interest, audibly. The virtual guide can also ask the visitor questions while at an exhibit, thus getting valuable feedback. The virtual guide will store the feedback along with a tone analysis of the visitor to determine if they were confused, happy, intrigued, angry, while at the exhibit.
